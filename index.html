        <h2>Before Tech </h2>
        <img id= "me" src= "\images\1229986_10100331281805919_1583961645_n.jpg" alt= "picture of me">

        <p>Before I got started in technology, I worked as an EMT. At first I worked for a private service, doing a combination
            of Doctors office transports, dialysis, and some 911 Emergency calls as Memphis Fire's backup. While this was a
            direct care medical position, it really taught the importance of customer service, or as it's called in medicine
            "Bedside Manner". I learned that while you might have a specific task to perform, a lot of the job was just being
            nice to the patient. <br>
            <br>
            This eventually led to me getting a job at a CCRC, that's Continuing Care Retirement Community. A type of retirement
            facility that specializes in all three stages of senoir life. Independant, Assisted, and Skilled Nursing.
            My duties expanded, not only did we provide emergency medical care to the residents on the indepentant living side,
            we were also responsible for life safety and security. Life Safety is a broad term describing maintaining fire alarms,
            emergency lighting, checking generators and breakers, fire extinguishers, and door locks. We also monitored the CCTV
            Cameras.

        <h2>My First Tech Job</h2>
        <img class= "certification" src="images\04294+CompTIA+Cert+Badges_Specialist+-+CIOS.png" alt = "certified IT operations specialist">
        <p>While working at the CCRC, I had already had my sights set on technology. I didn't know exactly where or what...but I 
            started learning some coding with python, as well as a little HTML, CSS and javascript. I didn't really use it, so 
            I eventually forgot most of it. I had started to study for the CompTia A+ exam, when the IT director asked if I wanted
            to assist him. We were in the midst of expanding, and it was too much for a single person. 
            I worked under him for a year, grinding out certifications in all my free time. I got my CompTia A+, Net +, and Sec + certs.
            We worked on everything from pulling cable, splicing connectors, to setting up firewalls and configuring Servers.
            He left close to my one year mark, for another company out of state. I immediately picked up the slack, I started making 
            phone calls, working with vendors, doing the orders and expense reports. A few months of that, while they searched for a 
            replacement, I eventually asked to be moved up.
        </p>

        <h2>Presently</h2>

        <p>
            Currently, I've been in IT for 3 years, and I'm working towards two seperate, but potentally related specialties.
            DevOps, and Security. In that effort, I'm learning as much as I can, from software development, to penetration testing,
            to cloud services. This class, ElearnSecurity's Junior penetration testing course, and google cloud certifications.
